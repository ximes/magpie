Description:
    This generates all empty file required for a new Atom

Example:
    rails generate atom AtomName FamilyName

    This will create:
        app/models/atoms/[family_name]/[atom_name].rb
        app/views/atoms/[family_name]/[atom_name]/show.erb
        spec/models/atoms/[family_name]/[atom_name]_spec.rb

    This will also append the following line to db/seeds.rb:
        Atom.create(name: [AtomName], class_name: "Atoms::[FamilyName]::[AtomName]", enabled: true)
